<!-- Tribute info -->
<div class="tribute-info show-on-scroll"><p>Frida Kahlo was an artist inspired by her country's popular culture as well as by European influences. She employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, sexuality, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary <em>Mexicayotl</em> movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.</p>
